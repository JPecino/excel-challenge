# excel-challenge
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this week's Challenge, you will organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

Given the provided data, what are three observations we can make about crowdfunding campaigns?

"Theater" is the parent category with the highest success rate.
"Plays" is the sub-category with the highest success rate.
Campaigns initiated in July appear to have the highest likelihood of success.
What constraints exist within this dataset?

The dataset may not account for the influence of diverse cultural interests in different countries, potentially leading to skewed success/failure rates.
The data doesn't consider the evolving dynamics of interest and activity in larger cities over 5 or 10-year periods, making year-wise analysis valuable in tracking trends.
What are some alternative tables or graphs we could generate, and how would they enhance our understanding?

Analyzing the number of contributions and how different sub-categories surpass their funding goals could reveal areas of significant interest. This perspective might overlap with success vs. failure charts but could also pinpoint areas for potential campaign focus.
Which statistical measure provides a more comprehensive summary of the data, the Mean or the Median?

Mean provides a more comprehensive data summary, and it is especially suitable in this context as median values are relatively close to each other.
Is there greater variability among successful or unsuccessful campaigns? Does this align with expectations, and why?

Successful campaigns exhibit more variability compared to unsuccessful ones. This outcome is in line with expectations because the success rates vary significantly between categories, with some being highly successful and others only moderately so.
